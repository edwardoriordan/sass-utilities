Sass Utilities
==============

Compass plugin with various Sass script utility functions. Includes 

* Functions to test if a variable, mixing and function exists
* Variable interpolation

### Coming (maybe!)

* Function and mixin interpolation - hopefully https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/626 gets into Sass soon so an extension doesn't have to worry about it.
